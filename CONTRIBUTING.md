   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash

   # or
   just deps
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Building

```bash
# Build for current platform
go build

# Or using just
just build

# Build for all platforms
just build-all
```

### Running

```bash
# Run directly
go run .

# Or using just
just run
```

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions
- Run `go fmt` before committing:

  ```bash
  go fmt ./...
  # or
  just fmt
  ```

- If you have `golangci-lint` installed:

  ```bash
  just lint
  ```

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes

3. Test your changes thoroughly

4. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

   We follow [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits]:

   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for test changes
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

5. Push to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Create a Pull Request on GitHub

## Testing

Currently, the project uses manual testing. We welcome contributions to add automated tests!

To manually test:

1. Build the application
2. Test with a real YNAB account (or create a test account)
3. Verify the export file is created correctly
4. Test on different platforms if possible

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of the changes
- Reference any related issues
- Include screenshots or examples if applicable
- Ensure your code builds successfully
- Update documentation if needed
